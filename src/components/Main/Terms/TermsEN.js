              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          b. <span>Right to Rectification</span>. A Data Subject has the right to demand that we correct without undue delay the Data Subject’s personal information which we have in our systems if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
          </li>
        <li>c. Right to Erasure/Right to Be Forgotten. A Data Subject has the right to demand that we erase the Data Subject’s personal information, and we shall erase it without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:

            <li>5. the Data Subject’s personal information has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          d. <span>Right to Restrict Processing</span>. A Data Subject has the right to restrict us in the ability of processing of the Data Subject’s information where one of the following applies:
            <ul>
            <li>1. the Data Subject contests the accuracy of the Data Subject’s personal information and we verify it;</li>
            <li>2. the processing is unlawful and the Data Subject wants to restrict it instead of erasure;</li>
            <li>3. we no longer need the Data Subject’s personal information, but the Data Subject needs it for establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li>
            <li>4. the Data Subject has objected to processing and we verify whether legitimate grounds override the Data Subject’s request.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          e. <span>Right to Data Portability</span>. A Data Subject has the right to receive the Data Subject’s personal information which the Data Subject provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and has the right to transmit such data to another company, where:
            <ul>
            <li>1. the processing is based on the Data Subject’s consent or on a contract; and</li>
            <li>2. the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
            <li>3. Where technically feasible, a Data Subject can demand that we transmit such data directly to another company.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          f. <span>Right to Object</span>. A Data Subject has the right to object to the processing of the Data Subject’s personal information based on legitimate interests. Upon such objection, we will no longer process the Data Subject’s personal information unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Where personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, a Data Subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of the Data Subject’s personal information for such marketing.
          </li>
        <li>
          g. <span>Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling</span>. A Data Subject has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects on the Data Subject. Please note that we don’t make any automated decisions including profiling based on information that we have about a Data Subject.
          </li>
        <li>h. <span>Right to Withdraw Consent</span>. A Data Subject has the right to withdraw the Data Subject’s consent for processing of the Data Subject’s personal information at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
        <li>i. <span>Right to Lodge a Complaint</span>. A Data Subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU Member State of the Data Subject’s residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement if the Data Subject deems that the processing of the Data Subject’s personal information infringes GDPR.</li>
        <li>j. <span>Breach Notification</span>. If a breach/unauthorized access of personal information takes place that is likely to “result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects”, we will notify the necessary EU supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.</li>
